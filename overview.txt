I followed the instructions in the Cassandra assignment video link that was shared on Canvas. After that, I made an account in Datastax, built a practice database, and made a keyspace named sales data. After that, I downloaded the bundle and produced it. I used Google Collab to connect to the database after that. After uploading the sales100.csv file, I produced three golden tables.
